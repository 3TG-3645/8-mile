        <abbr title="Eminem’s stage name comes from his real name
        Eminem came from humble beginnings to become one of the 21st century’s highest-selling artists across the board, and not just in hip-hop. But when he was a high schooler just starting to rap, he never imagined he’d be the superstar Eminem.
        
        When he first started rapping with his high-school friend Mike Ruby, the duo adopted the names “Manix” and “M&M.” Eminem chose his name from his initials, but eventually changed it to what we know today. Given the similarity of the M&M name to the popular candy, it’s unlikely he would have been able to get away with much as an unknown rapper with that specific name.
        
        Eminem and his partner in rhyme started recording their own tracks in Ruby’s basement at the turn of the 1990s. By the beginning of the next decade, Eminem’s name would be known all around the world. "><img id="eminemlogo" src="1200px-Eminem_logo.svg.png" alt="Eminem Logo"></abbr></a>
